<h1>About this Project</h1>

<h2>Developer</h2>
This game mod/extension browser/forum was created completely in code by Andrew "rubenwardy" Ward.

<h2>Why a new one?</h2>
The current mod forum is, well unorganized and not very well managed.<br />
That is why, I am making a new one, for c55 to possibly implement <br />
(if not, it will still be used by the three mod-manager mods/scripts).<br />

<h2>The Aims</h2>
<ul>
<li>An easier way to find mods</li>
<li>A like/dislike system means players can find the best mods for them</li>
<li>A database for the Mod-Manager Mods</li>
<li>No more: minetest is soo boring, there is no mobs, or cart... :(</li>
<li>No more: how do i install mods?</li>
</ul>

<h2>It features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Categories and Tag Searching</li>
<li>Like</li>
<li>Mod entry adding and editing</li>
</ul>
